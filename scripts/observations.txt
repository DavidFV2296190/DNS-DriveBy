## Wigle
- WiGLE has unique MAC Address entires, so data points can't be plotted linearly
- [] = unknown, [ESS] = no encryption
- 200/2467 (8% Open WiFi networks) when sorting unique MAC Addresses - by AP
- 72/1039  (6% Open WiFi networks) when sorting unique SSID's

## ESP8266
- 768/3179 (24%) when sorting unique MAC addresses, exclude Printers
- 442/1876 (23%) sort Unique SSID's, exclude printers

- 929/2974 (31%) by MAC 
- 602/2080 (28%) by SSID



Things to compare:
- % Open: Wigle vs ESP8266
- OPEN Representation: discovered vs hit
- Representation: Names (ESP8266 vs Wigle Total)

Disclaimer:
- Skewed stats: 5ghz, no multiple entries, ESSID's being conflated? 
- DNS DriveBy vs Open Pinger: discovering vs connecting times
- internal memory caching speeds, different antenna being used
- printers, and spam networks?  better rep for connection / algorithm...
